# Report-Automation
This script cleans up an exported CSV file from a ticketing software like Linear (can be slightly changed for Jira)
The exported file usually has odd formats and columns that aren't useful for my purposes
The script keeps the useful columns and fields that can be used to present to internal teams (product, engineering, support)

This is a script I use for my work place regularly to make monthly reporting quick and easy
